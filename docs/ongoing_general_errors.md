## 🧪 Resolved Issues & Implementation Refinements

1. **Race Condition in `evaluateReadyState` (Resolved - May 24)**:
   - **Problem**: Host evaluation of player readiness was susceptible to race conditions when multiple players marked ready concurrently, leading to duplicate phase advancements.
   - **Solution**: Implemented an in-memory set `_advancedStateKeys` tracking unique state hashes (`roomCode_phase_rotationIndex_readerId`) to ensure each state is only advanced once.
   - **Regression Warning**: Any changes to state evaluation must check `_advancedStateKeys` to prevent double-navigation bugs.

2. **Firestore Listener Leaks (Resolved - May 24)**:
   - **Problem**: Stream listeners for game state and player sub-documents were instantiated without keeping subscription handles, causing them to leak and duplicate on re-joins.
   - **Solution**: Added stream subscription fields `_roomSubscription` and `_playersSubscription` inside `GameService`, ensuring previous streams are cancelled before starting new ones and during `dispose()`.

3. **API Key Exposure & Transactional Integrity (Resolved - May 24/25)**:
   - **Problem**: API keys were previously passed in request URLs. Additionally, concurrent client writes could bypass similarity checks.
   - **Solution**: Moved the API key to the `x-goog-api-key` HTTP header. Applied Firestore transaction blocks around all card answer submissions.

4. **Host-Only Phase Advancement Failure (Resolved - May 24)**:
   - **Problem**: If a host disconnected, phase transitions were permanently frozen.
   - **Solution**: Added a 5-second periodic heartbeat updating player `lastSeen` in Firestore. The host prunes inactive players, and players automatically trigger host transfer if the host document is deleted.

5. **Mid-Game Join State Corruption & Spectator Mode (Resolved - May 25)**:
   - **Problem**: Players joining a game in progress corrupted active player card queues.
   - **Solution**: Late-joining players are assigned `PlayerRole.spectator` and shown passive spectator UIs, and are filtered out of all gameplay loops and readiness calculations.

6. **Mid-Game Disconnect Card Orphans & Recalculation (Resolved - May 25)**:
   - **Problem**: Inactive or disconnected players left orphan cards in the rotation plan.
   - **Solution**: Host bridges the card assignments (bypassing the departed player), dynamically regenerates rotations using `RotationEngine`, and auto-advances the reader.
