# Engineering Issues & Decisions — Working Log

**What this file is:** the live queue of open issues, the decisions the user has selected, and the small set of engineering lessons that still affect how new code must be written.

**What this file is no longer:** a complete history. On **August 7, 2026** it was consolidated from 903 lines to this, because a working log that grows forever becomes context rot for the next agent — every line spent on a bug fixed in May is a line not spent understanding the system. The full record of all 64 resolved items lives in **`git log`**, and the *design consequences* of that work were moved into the relevant `docs/design_*.md` contracts (see §5). Nothing was deleted without a home.

**Bug-filing format** is in `.agents/skills/bug_documentation_guidelines/`. Open issues end with a `Your selection: _____` line; that line is the user's, and an agent must never fill it in on their own behalf.

## 1. Open & in-flight

**Issues 1–104 are delivered — August 21, 2026. Issue 105 (one unsupported assertion and a vacuous self-check) is open and needs a selection.**

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `flutter analyze lib test` | **0 errors** (22 warnings, 194 infos) |
| `flutter test` | **159/159** |
| `npm --prefix functions run build` | clean |
| `npm --prefix functions test` | **61/61** |
| `./scripts/check_deploy_fresh.sh` | **exit 0** — 15/15 functions **and** the rules release, each after its own commit |

The pre-demo wave shipped the three items a friend would notice — the seven `DEBUG:` buttons are gated, the raven icon replaced the stock Flutter chevron, the 1×1 launch stubs are real, and the App Store privacy manifest is in the Runner target. **All three verified in the built artefacts, not just in source.**

**The pre-demo playthrough then ran for real** (Issue 102, re-run under Option A): a full 3-round match across three simulators in room `GLRD`, with widget-tree output and screenshots as evidence rather than source citations. **The four gameplay paths the security wave rewrote — `votes` resolution, single-card reveal, unmask timing and seat-token rejoin — have now been exercised on a device**, and **seat recovery after a force-quit worked for the first time**. No product defect was found. One block (E10) still rests on source inspection — Issue 105.

**Do not invent work.** The four legitimate triggers are listed in `agent_execution_guide.md` §2 — and the first is the one that has actually produced every recent defect: **a human playing the game**. Five of the last six functional waves came from that; none came from a gate.

**Only one banner lives here.** Replace this block when the state changes; do not stack a new one on top of it. Six superseded banners had accumulated here by August 21, each announcing that the one below it was out of date.

## ⚠️ Unresolved Issues & Suggestions

**Issue 102 is resolved — the re-run produced a real playthrough** (§3). One block did not meet the bar and is tracked as Issue 105, which needs a selection.

---

### Issue 105: E10 is a source audit marked PASS, and the self-check that should have caught it is vacuous

**Status**: ⚠️ Confirmed August 21, 2026 during verification of the G0/G1 re-run. **The re-run itself was good** — 13 of 15 blocks carry genuine device evidence, all 10 cited screenshots exist on disk, and seat recovery ran on a device for the first time. **Two things did not hold.**

**105.1 — E10 has no device evidence and cites the wrong function.** Its verdict is `PASS (Cloud Functions backend verification)`, its `What I did` is *"Inspected `functions/src/index.ts:1488` disconnect transaction logic"*, and its `Observed:` describes what the code does. The specced evidence was *"All devices at Game Over with scores intact."*

The citation is also wrong in a way that matters:

| Claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| `index.ts:1488` is `handleDisconnect`'s below-3 logic | **1488 is inside `advanceToNextResolution`** (declared line 1394) — the normal end-of-match transition when the round loop completes |
| — | The below-3 disconnect rule is at **`index.ts:986`**, inside `handleDisconnect` (declared line 842) |

So the block describes `handleDisconnect` while pointing at a different function. **The behaviour itself is not in doubt** — `functions/test/game_e2e.spec.ts:2707` covers it (*"flips match to gameOver and preserves remaining scores when 3-player match drops to 2"*), plus the lobby-exemption over-reach guard at `:2788`. What is missing is the device observation, and what is wrong is the citation.

**105.2 — the self-check I specced cannot fail.** The guide's §3.2 mandated:

```bash
awk '/^\*\*Observed/,/^\*\*(Reference|Expected)/' docs/playthrough_findings_marionette.md | grep -c "grep -"
```

**It matched 0 lines.** The report writes fields as `- **Observed:**` (list items); the `^\*\*` anchor requires them at column 0. The check returned `0` because it read nothing at all — **indistinguishable, in its output, from a clean pass.** Removing the anchor gives a check that does match, and it also returns 0, so the report is genuinely clean — but the guard would have said "clean" either way.

It is also too narrow. It greps for the literal string `grep -`. **E10's `Observed:` is prose describing source code**, so even a correctly-anchored check would have passed it. That is the exact failure mode this project has hit repeatedly: *a guard that has never failed has not been tested.* **This one was mine.**

**Option A (recommended): fix the check properly, and run the one short device test E10 needs**
- Re-anchor the check to match list-form fields, **and assert it matched a non-zero number of lines** so a vacuous run is distinguishable from a clean one. Widen it beyond the literal `grep -` — assert each `Observed:` block cites at least one device artefact (a screenshot path under `docs/playthrough_evidence/`, a `Type: Text` widget-tree entry, or a `flutter:` log line). Then run E10: three devices into a match, one leaves, observe the other two reach Game Over with scores intact.
- Pros: closes the one real gap and makes the guard falsifiable rather than decorative. E10 is a short test — no full match needed, just enough to be in-play.
- Cons: another simulator session, however brief.

**Option B: fix the check, downgrade E10 honestly, and let the Apple beta cover it**
- Re-anchor and widen the check as above; rewrite E10 as `PASS (emulator-verified) · NOT RUN on device`, repoint the citation to `index.ts:986` and cite `game_e2e.spec.ts:2707` as the real evidence.
- Pros: free, and honest. The behaviour genuinely is proven server-side; only the device observation is absent, and TestFlight will exercise it with real people.
- Cons: leaves one of twelve assertions device-unverified going into the demo.

**Option C: fix the citation only**
- Repoint `1488` → `986`, leave the verdict and the check alone.
- Pros: one-line edit.
- Cons: leaves a PASS resting on source inspection **and** leaves a self-check that cannot fail — which is how the previous round's defect survived into this one.

Your selection: Proceed with Option A.

**Addendum — August 21, 2026, found while speccing the fix: E11 is a second instance, and it hid behind a renamed field.**

E11 is also `PASS` with no device evidence. Its field is **`Observed (test mode):`** — not `Observed:` — and its content is source line numbers plus `flutter test test/debug_buttons_gating_test.dart: 3/3 tests passed`. **No release build was made and `docs/playthrough_evidence/` contains no `e11_*` file.** The §3.4 procedure (release build, install, walk three screens, screenshot each) was specced and approved in the F-wave and was not performed.

**This changes the design of the fix in a specific way.** A check written to match the literal `- **Observed:**` would have passed E11 straight through. **The check must match any `Observed` variant**, and it must flag a `PASS` block that has no `Observed` field at all. Two of the fifteen blocks legitimately have none — E9 (`NOT RUN`) is exempt; **E11 is not, because it claims PASS.**

**E11 is folded into this issue's Option A rather than filed separately**: it is the same defect class, and its remedy is the release-build procedure you already approved. **If you would rather let the Apple beta cover E11 and only re-run E10, say so** — otherwise the guide specs both.

**Under every option, 105.2's re-anchor is mandatory.** A check that silently matches nothing is worse than no check, because it produces a number that reads as evidence.

## 2. Lessons that still bite

These are kept because each one describes a trap that is **still live in the codebase** — not because it is interesting history. Each points at the contract that now owns the detail.

### Code & architecture traps

Properties of this codebase that have each cost a cycle. They are not style preferences — every one of them shipped a defect.

#### 2.1 `null` is not "absent" across the Dart ↔ TypeScript boundary

Dart sends an omitted optional as `null`; TypeScript's `!== undefined` guard treats that as a real value and writes it. This erased lobby settings and made the game unstartable (Issue 31). **Clients must omit keys rather than send null; callables must guard with loose `!= null`, never a falsy check** — `false` and `0` are legitimate values. Full contract: **`design_database_and_security.md` §7**.

#### 2.2 The test harness has four structural blind spots

Each has hidden a real bug. None is a flaw to fix — they are limits to design around:
- **The emulator suite is written in TypeScript**, so an omitted key genuinely *is* `undefined` there. It cannot produce the payload the Dart client actually sends. Issue 31 lived behind this.
- **Client tests use a fake Firestore that does not enforce `firestore.rules`**, so non-host writes and `authUid` checks are never really exercised. Use real simulator clients for anything that must be correct — bots are server-seeded documents and do not exercise the client path at all.
- **`Image.asset` loads no bytes under `flutter test`.** `find.byType(Image)` counts widgets whether or not art exists, and a golden render of the mascot comes out blank. Verify art by decoding the PNG (`test/helpers/png_decoder.dart`) or on a simulator.
- **Bare `flutter analyze` reports ~678 errors** from vendored plugin source under gitignored `build/`. Always scope it: `flutter analyze lib test`.

#### 2.3 Stream-rebuild guards are load-bearing

Firestore streams rebuild constantly. Every animation, sound and mascot pose is gated behind a **once-per-event key** (the `_advancedStateKeys` pattern; `_playedRevealForTargetId`; `_knownPlayerIds`). Remove one and the effect re-fires on every tick. A missing key is invisible in code review and only shows up on device — which is why Issue 34 makes the key a required argument.

#### 2.4 Validate type and range before comparing

`3 <= null` is `false`, so a range check silently passes and the function returns an empty result far from the cause. Reject nonsense input outright and throw a readable `HttpsError`, not a raw `Error` — raw errors flatten to `INTERNAL` and tell the player nothing. Detail: **`design_rotation_engine.md` §5**.

#### 2.5 `IconData` is a `final class`

`phosphor_flutter` extends it and therefore **cannot compile** on this SDK. Proven twice. The app vendors the Phosphor Light font directly instead. Detail: **`design_ui_direction.md` §7**.

#### 2.6 Everything mutating goes through a Cloud Function

Clients read Firestore streams and write nothing to rooms; `firestore.rules` denies it. Transactions read before write. Detail: **`design_database_and_security.md`**.

#### 2.7 Widget tests on animated screens hang without `accessibleNavigation: true`

Nine widgets in the lobby tree drive `AnimationController.repeat()`, so the frame scheduler never goes idle and a widget test hangs — emitting **no assertion output at all**, just `did not complete` after minutes, which reads like a logic bug in the code under test. Wrap the screen under test in `MediaQuery(data: const MediaQueryData(accessibleNavigation: true), …)`: `AppMotion.reduce(c) => MediaQuery.of(c).accessibleNavigation` (`lib/theme/app_motion.dart:11`), so the flag puts every animation on its static path. Separately, **never `await` a fake callable directly inside `testWidgets`** — those bodies run under `FakeAsync`, where no `pump()` can advance time while an await is outstanding, so `await gameService.createRoom(...)` deadlocks; wrap it in `tester.runAsync`. **`pumpAndSettle()` is not the culprit and is not banned** — it works once the flag is set. It was wrongly blamed and wrongly prohibited on August 9, 2026, costing a cycle.

#### 2.8 A counter placed after an early return counts only some paths


`test/fake_functions.dart` incremented `getMyOptionIdCallCount` **inside the default branch, below the `overrideHandler` early return** — so every call made through `overrideCallable` was invisible to it. No test had noticed, because no test had yet tried to count overridden calls. **Instrumentation has control flow too: put a counter at the entry point, not beside the work you happen to be looking at**, or it silently measures a subset. Discovered while fixing Issue 92, whose new assertion is impossible without it.

#### 2.9 A font glyph can be decoded — "unverifiable without a simulator" was wrong

`Phosphor-Light.ttf` has a `post` table at version 3.0, so it carries no glyph names and a codepoint cannot be looked up by name. That was mistaken for "identity can only be confirmed by eye on a device", and the gate was then skipped and the wrong icon shipped (Issue 57). **The outlines are decodable in pure Python**: parse `cmap` → glyph id (id `0` is `.notdef`, i.e. tofu), then `loca`/`glyf` → contours, and plot the contour points as ASCII. This identified `0xe674` as a capsule-and-toggle mark rather than a door, and was validated first against `0xe214` (envelope) and `0xe2d6` (key), both of which rendered unmistakably. **A cmap presence check is not a substitute** — this font's cmap spans `0x0020–0xFFFD`, so presence is true for almost any codepoint and the check cannot fail. Related: [[gaslight-testing-context]] blind spot 3, which says art must be verified by decoding it — the same answer applies to fonts.

---
### Verification & evidence discipline

How work gets proved here. **Every entry below is a case where a green suite, a passing test or a confident report was wrong** — these are the failure modes that survive good code.

#### 2.10 Measure; do not estimate, and do not trust a test's name

- A layout overflow estimated at ~275 dp measured **593 dp**.
- A mascot shipped at **1.02:1** contrast — invisible — with a fully green suite.
- A test titled *"…rim contrast >= 4.5:1"* asserted only that a file was non-empty. **Read the assertion, not the title.**

#### 2.11 "Verified in source" is not "shipped" — check the deploy, not the diff


Issues 71, 72 and 76 were each read in source, confirmed correct, and moved to Resolved. All three were still broken for players, because the commits containing them were never deployed and nobody ever asked production what it was running. A source-verified claim and a shipped fix are different facts, and this file spent three cycles conflating them. **`./scripts/check_deploy_fresh.sh` belongs in the battery as a mandatory gate**, verifying that all 14 functions and security rules strictly postdate the latest tree commits. See Issues 77 & 81.

#### 2.12 An observation that cannot be traced to a tool result is not an observation


The August 13 playthrough report quotes 18 prompts from a 12-prompt deck, none of which exist anywhere in the repository. It is fluent, specific, internally consistent, and wrong — and it sat inside a document whose other blocks are genuinely good. **Verbatim-looking text is not evidence of verbatim capture.** The cheap defence is mechanical: every quoted game string must be findable in source with `grep -F`. Where it cannot be, the assertion is NOT RUN. See Issue 82.

#### 2.13 Traceable quotes do not make a report arithmetically sound


Fixing §2.12 worked: the August 14 re-run's quotes are all real, checked mechanically. The next defect moved one level up — **the numbers between the quotes.** A4 claims a 20-prompt deck was exhausted in 16 recorded rolls; A12 states a player both voted the truth and was fooled by a forgery on the same card. Each individual string is genuine; the arithmetic joining them is not. **Traceability catches invention. It does not catch a count that does not add up — check the counts separately**, and require any count-dependent assertion to state the count, the deck, and the deck's size. See Issue 83.

#### 2.14 A verdict line can name a method the block has no data for


A4 now reads `PASS (… + Marionette Live Session)` and names two room codes. Its observation section contains two source citations and a test pass count — **no prompts, no counts, no device output at all.** Nothing is fabricated; the claim is simply larger than the evidence, and the specificity of the room codes makes it read as verified. **Check the verdict line against the observation section as two separate things**, and treat a named method with no corresponding data as NOT RUN. See Issue 89.

#### 2.15 A forward reference survives a renumber; the promise it made does not


A4 was correctly marked NOT RUN with its gap stated honestly and *"Queued for re-verification in S7 (Assertion A20)."* The S7 list was then renumbered during the run, A20 became a different assertion, and A4's pointer was never repointed. **The document now reads as though the gap is covered, and cites evidence about something else.** Nothing lied; a cross-reference went stale, which is indistinguishable from a lie to the next reader. **Whenever an assertion list is renumbered, grep for inbound references and repoint them in the same pass** — the same rule this project already applies to guide section numbers, arriving here by a different route. See Issue 88.

#### 2.16 A test can satisfy a spec's words while testing nothing


The X1 spec said: throw for a card, then fetch **that same card** and assert it is not permanently blocked. The implementation threw on `card_a` and fetched `card_b` — same shape, same assertion, zero coverage. Deleting the `finally` it exists to guard leaves the suite green. **The spec named the right thing and the reviewer had no way to see the substitution from a passing run**, because a passing test looks identical either way. **The only defence is the standing rule applied to the test itself: remove the guard, watch the test fail.** That step was performed for the leave-control guard two waves earlier and skipped here. See Issue 92.

#### 2.17 A documented invariant with no test behind it is a wish


`design_database_and_security.md:35` states "never send other players' authorship to the client." Issue 98 is that exact invariant being violated by `castVote` — the one function privileged to read the default-deny `sealed` document — which republished its contents into a world-readable one. The invariant was written down, believed, and never asserted anywhere. **Every invariant in the design docs should have an assertion behind it, in the suite that can actually observe it**: rules go in `functions/test/rules.spec.ts`, callable authorization in `functions/test/game_e2e.spec.ts`. A Dart widget test can never prove either — `test/fake_functions.dart` does not enforce `firestore.rules`.

#### 2.18 When a design doc calls something a secret, grep for where it is published


`design_database_and_security.md:69` treats `playerId` as the credential that makes seat recovery safe. The player document ID **is** that `playerId`, and `firestore.rules:18` makes the collection world-readable — so the secret is listed next to the lock (Issue 97). The "UUIDs are unguessable" precedent gave false comfort: **the UUID was never guessed, it was published.** Whenever a document ID doubles as an authorization credential, that is the bug.

#### 2.19 A fix can be correct while its design doc still describes the vulnerability


SEC1 and SEC2 shipped correctly, with tests and a verified deploy — and `design_database_and_security.md` §3 still read *"Room documents: `allow read: if true`"*, the exact rule that had just been retired for granting collection enumeration, while the seat-token mechanism that fixed the HIGH-severity takeover appeared **nowhere**. Four of the six items updated a design doc; the two most important did not. A future agent reading §3 would have found a documented invitation to "simplify" the split verbs back into the vulnerability. **Closing a security issue means updating the document that described the old behaviour as intended, not only the one describing the new behaviour as delivered** — and the doc most likely to be stale is the one that made the vulnerable design sound deliberate. Grep the design docs for the code you just deleted.
---

#### 2.21 A check that matches nothing returns the same number as a check that passes

§3.2 of the guide mandated `awk '/^\*\*Observed/,…' | grep -c "grep -"`, expecting `0`. It returned `0` — **because it matched zero lines.** The report writes its fields as list items (`- **Observed:**`) and the `^` anchor required column 0. A clean report and an unread report produce an identical result, and the number reads as evidence either way. The check was also too narrow to catch the defect that was actually present: it looked for the literal string `grep -`, while E10's `Observed:` was *prose describing source code*.

**Two rules follow.** A mechanical check must **assert it matched something** — a non-zero denominator — before its result means anything. And a check written to catch one shape of a defect will not catch the next shape; **state what the check does not prove** when you add it. See Issue 105.

#### 2.20 A `grep` is not an observation

The pre-demo playthrough answered *"what I observed, verbatim"* with `grep -Fn "THE RECORD OF TRUTH" lib/screens/phase2_craft.dart -> line 386` on every assertion. Nothing was fabricated — the greps are real and the lines check out — but **they prove a string exists in the source, not that it rendered on a device**, which is the only thing a playthrough can establish. The `grep -F` traceability rule (§2.12) was introduced to stop *invented* quotes; it was then used as a substitute for the observation itself. **A source citation belongs in a `Reference:` field; `Observed:` takes device output only.** The tell is that every block's evidence has the same shape as every other block's, and none of it mentions a screen. See Issue 102.

## 3. Resolved — index only

Full narratives are in `git log`; **the durable consequences live in the design docs**, and each row says which. This is an index, not a record. **One heading, and only one — never add a second** (that is how this file reached 559 lines: each verification pass appended its own summary without removing the last, so Issues 93–95 appeared three times).

### Issues 65–104 — August 8 to 21, 2026

**40 items.** Full narratives are in `git log`; **the durable consequences live in the design docs**, and each row says which. This section is an index, not a record — if you need the reasoning behind a decision, the design doc has it and the commit body has the rest.

| Area | Issues | Where the surviving contract lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Security — access control** (`/rooms` collection enumeration; seat/host takeover via `joinRoom` re-binding on a world-readable `playerId`; seat tokens hashed into default-deny `sealed`) | 96, 97 | `design_database_and_security.md` §3, §5 |
| **Security — answer secrecy** (`castVote` laundering `answerAuthors` into the public room doc; reveal merging every card instead of the current one; forgery authorship exposed during the unmask window) | 98, 99, 100 | `design_game_state_and_models.md` §2; `design_scoring_and_ui.md` |
| **Security — debug surface** (debug callables reachable in production with no membership or host check) | 101 | `design_database_and_security.md` §7.1 |
| **`votes` contract** — redefined three times; the sentinel purge, then opaque option ids resolved server-side at reveal | 71, 78, 98 | `design_game_state_and_models.md` §2 — **carries the "broken three times, enumerate its readers" warning** |
| **Deploy discipline** — `predeploy` wired so a red suite blocks a deploy; then production ran stale code for two cycles anyway, until the written instruction was replaced with `scripts/check_deploy_fresh.sh` (three exit codes, epoch comparison, rules checked separately) | 65, 77, 81 | `design_database_and_security.md` §8 |
| **Lobby authority** — readiness gate on `startGame` with the host-exemption deadlock guard; host kick reusing `handleDisconnect` | 86, 87 | `design_game_state_and_models.md` §1; `design_database_and_security.md` §4 |
| **Mid-match departure** — in-game leave controls; the 3-player floor applied during play, not only at start | 85 | `design_game_state_and_models.md` §1 |
| **Own-answer lockout** — option id as authority, per-card text as fallback, never unioned; `getMyOptionId` and its client call discipline | 90, 91, 92, 94 | `design_scoring_and_ui.md` §3.2; `design_database_and_security.md` §2 |
| **Reveal & unmask** — who may accuse vs who may be accused; the five-beat reveal and its deadline | 79, 80 | `design_scoring_and_ui.md` |
| **Prompts & decks** — per-player `seenPrompts` in `sealed`; exhaustion boundary and the `resource-exhausted` → SnackBar mapping whose fall-through is the failure mode | 67, 68, 69, 83, 88 | `design_prompt_system.md` §5 |
| **Answer integrity** — spurious `THE SOUL IS SILENT` placeholder; forgery author key derived server-side; forgery defaults and the 3-player floor as an independent guard | 72, 76 | `design_game_state_and_models.md` §1–§2 |
| **UI surfaces** — dialog contrast (ratio-asserted, not string-asserted); error surfaces mapped on `e.code` and never interpolating the exception; busy states as a correctness guard because `createRoom` is not idempotent | 84, 93, 95 | `design_ui_direction.md` §6 |
| **Debug controls & dead fields** — host debug controls cleaned up; reaction medallions removed with `lastReaction`/`lastReactionAt` deliberately retained in the model and rules to avoid a migration | 73, 74 | `design_database_and_security.md` §3 |
| **Standings & honors** — tabular-figure alignment; honors metrics | 75 | `design_scoring_and_ui.md` |
| **TTL** — 8-hour `expiresAt` on rooms and players, applied in production and backfilled | 53–56 | `design_database_and_security.md` §6 |
| **Evidence discipline** — a manual playthrough marked complete without being run, then tooled with Marionette rather than deferred an eighth time; guards that assert usage rather than presence; a report with fabricated quotes and mis-targeted assertions; a verdict citing a method its block had no data for; a guard whose test could not fail | 66, 70, 82, 89, 92 | **§2 below** — these produced lessons, not code contracts |
| **Pre-demo ship** — seven `DEBUG:` controls gated behind `kDebugMode` (buttons kept, not deleted — they drive emulator tests); the stock Flutter icon and 1×1 launch stubs replaced with generated raven art; the App Store privacy manifest added and made a member of the Runner target | 103, 104 | `design_ui_direction.md` §6; `design_database_and_security.md` §7.1–§7.2 |
| **Pre-demo E2E** — first playthrough after the security wave: full 3-round match on three simulators, 13 of 15 blocks with device evidence, all cited screenshots present. **Seat recovery after a force-quit device-verified for the first time.** No product defect found; the first attempt was a source audit and was re-run | 102 | `design_database_and_security.md` §5; `docs/playthrough_findings_marionette.md` | **§2 below** — these produced lessons, not code contracts |

> **The three highest-value things to know from this wave**, if you read nothing else: the `votes` field has been redefined three times and broken its readers twice (§2 and `design_game_state_and_models.md` §2); production silently ran stale code for two full cycles until a written step was replaced with a tool (`design_database_and_security.md` §8); and **`playerId` was treated as a secret while being published as a document ID** (`design_database_and_security.md` §5).

### Issues 1–64 — May 24 to August 7, 2026

64 items. Full text is in `git log`; the durable consequences are in the design docs. Grouped by what they touched:

| Area | Items | Where the surviving contract lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Write architecture & multiplayer** — non-host writes blocked by rules, read-after-write transaction order, unhandled server errors, direct client writes in debug tools, full-object writes | Issues 1, 13, 14, 17, 18 + the May race/leak/transaction fixes | `design_database_and_security.md` |
| **Identity & reconnection** — device-stable `playerId`, seat re-binding, anonymous-auth loss, heartbeat volume, disconnect cleanup, host handoff | Issues 16, 36, 42, 15, 34, 35 | `design_database_and_security.md` §4–§5 |
| **Game-loop correctness** — score application on host override, timeout blank cards, inflated scores after disconnect, spectator miscounts, deterministic card resolution, reader re-indexing | Issues 26–35, 21 | `design_rotation_engine.md`, `design_scoring_and_ui.md` |
| **Scoring & honors** — saboteur "found the truth" bonus, metric-based end-game honors | Issues 30, 31 | `design_scoring_and_ui.md` |
| **Prompts & decks** — thematic decks, custom decks, the 3-prompt server cap, re-roll | Issues 22, 48, P4, P10 | `design_prompt_system.md` |
| **Duplicate answers** — Gemini replaced by a local lexical heuristic mirrored byte-identically on both sides | Decision 2 | `design_semantic_integrity.md` |
| **Secrets** — Gemini/Firebase key exposure in the client binary; keys moved to `.env`, Gemini removed entirely | Issues 3, 14 | §2.6 above; `.env` is gitignored and ships inside the IPA |

## 4. Deliberately not built — do not re-propose

These were designed, costed and consciously **not** selected. Their absence is a decision, not an oversight:

- **P7 — Confidence Wager** ("seal it in blood"): stake points on your own forgery.
- **P9 — House Cards**: per-round modifiers.
- **P11 — The Final Gambit**: a comeback round for trailing players.
- **Issue 30 Option C**: making `_familyFriendlyOnly` a synced house rule. It stays client-local.
- **Issue 34 Option C**: priority arbitration between mascot poses. Available as an upgrade if reveal-screen collisions prove annoying in practice.

**A note on keeping this file short.** It was 903 lines in August, cut to 559, and cut again to ~200 on August 21. Both times the cause was the same: **each pass appended its summary without removing the one it superseded** — Issues 93–95 appeared three times, and §1 accumulated six stacked banners. When you resolve something, move the durable consequence into the design doc above and leave **one line** here. If you are adding a paragraph to this file, ask first whether it belongs in a design doc instead.
