# Engineering Issues & Decisions — Working Log

**What this file is:** the live queue of open issues, the decisions the user has selected, and the small set of engineering lessons that still affect how new code must be written.

**What this file is no longer:** a complete history. On **August 7, 2026** it was consolidated from 903 lines to this, because a working log that grows forever becomes context rot for the next agent — every line spent on a bug fixed in May is a line not spent understanding the system. The full record of all 64 resolved items lives in **`git log`**, and the *design consequences* of that work were moved into the relevant `docs/design_*.md` contracts (see §5). Nothing was deleted without a home.

**Bug-filing format** is in `.agents/skills/bug_documentation_guidelines/`. Open issues end with a `Your selection: _____` line; that line is the user's, and an agent must never fill it in on their own behalf.

## 🧪 Resolved Issues & Implementation Refinements

8. **Issue 53: 8-Hour Firestore TTL Policy (Resolved - August 10, 2026)**:
   - **Problem**: Rooms and player documents persisted indefinitely in production Firestore after clients abandoned them.
   - **Solution**: Defined `ROOM_TTL_MS = 8 * 60 * 60 * 1000` (8 hours) and helper `ttlFrom(nowMs)` in `functions/src/index.ts`. Written `expiresAt: ttlFrom(nowMs)` at creation on room and host player documents in `createRoom`, on joining/rejoining player documents in `joinRoom`, and refreshed on room updates (`startGame`, `updateLobbySettings`, `advancePhaseInternal`). Added `'expiresAt'` to field write denylist in `firestore.rules`, enforcing backend-only write authority for TTL timestamps while keeping client `lastSeen` updates allowed.
   - **Observed Falsifying Output**:
     ```text
     1) Issue 53: 8-Hour Firestore TTL Policy writes expiresAt on room and players at creation within a +-5-second window:
        AssertionError: expected undefined to have property 'expiresAt'
     ```
   - **Over-reach Guard**: Verified client updates to `lastSeen` on player documents still succeed while client updates supplying `expiresAt` are rejected by security rules (`functions/test/rules.spec.ts`). Documented production `gcloud firestore fields ttls update` commands in `docs/design_database_and_security.md`.

## 🧪 Resolved Issues & Implementation Refinements

1. **Logo Mascot Swap to Crow (Resolved - August 8, 2026)**:
   - **Problem**: `lib/widgets/lobby_logo.dart` rendered `Image.asset('assets/images/gaslight_mascot.png')` (the old gas lantern character) wrapped in a `ClipRRect`, leaving a 251 KB orphaned image asset in the release build and visually misaligning with the crow mascot system. Furthermore, `body.png` contained baked-in white eyeball pixels and palette-indexed quantization transparency bugs.
   - **Solution**: Replaced `gaslight_mascot.png` with `RavenMascot(state: RavenState.idle, size: 80)` inside an 80×80 container in `lib/widgets/lobby_logo.dart`, preserving the lamplight flicker glow animation and dropping `ClipRRect`. Deleted `assets/images/gaslight_mascot.png` (-251 KB savings). Re-exported `body.png` and `eye_closed.png` as 32-bit RGBA PNGs across 1x, 2x, and 3x densities with 100% solid dark body fill (`#2E2A26`), separating the white open eye art onto `eye_open.png` and the closed brass eyelid arc onto `eye_closed.png`. Added `test/lobby_logo_test.dart` asserting `RavenMascot` presence.

2. **Issue 34: Expanded Crow Pose Vocabulary & Game Moment Wiring (Resolved - August 8, 2026)**:
   - **Problem**: Mascot animation timing, reduced motion checks, timer cancellation, and deduplication logic were hand-written per screen, threatening boilerplate explosion as Task T5 added seven new poses across four screens.
   - **Solution**: Implemented `RavenPoseHost` mixin in `lib/widgets/raven_pose_host.dart` (Issue 34 Option A) with a required `onceKey` parameter for deduplication, automatic `AppMotion.reduce(context)` handling, post-frame callback execution, and timer disposal. Expanded `RavenState` enum and animation transform logic in `lib/widgets/raven_mascot.dart` for Tier 1 poses (`alert`, `peck`, `preen`, `startle`, `bow`) and Tier 2 poses (`caw`, `flap`). Generated Tier 2 assets (`beak_open.png`, `wing_up.png`) at 1x (256x256), 2.0x (512x512), and 3.0x (768x768). Migrated `lobby_screen.dart`, `phase3_vote.dart`, `phase4_reveal.dart`, and `game_over_screen.dart` to `RavenPoseHost`, chaining reveal triggers (`startle` -> `preen` -> `bow`) by event priority. Verified with unit/contract test suites in `test/raven_mascot_test.dart` and `test/raven_pose_host_test.dart`.

3. **Issue 35 / Task T6: Pre-rendered Frame Sequences for Transient Crow Poses (Resolved - August 8, 2026)**:
   - **Problem**: Transform-based layer motion (`Transform.translate/rotate/scale`) produced rigid movement lacking secondary feather ruffling, squash, and stretch.
   - **Solution**: Converted all 10 transient poses (`ruffle`, `startle`, `hop`, `peck`, `bow`, `alert`, `preen`, `fly`, `flap`, `caw`) to pre-rendered 256×256 px grid sprite sheets generated deterministically via `scripts/build_sprite_sheets.py`. Implemented dual-renderer architecture in `lib/widgets/raven_mascot.dart`: resting states (`idle`, `sleep`) remain on the layered `Stack` renderer for stochastic eye blinking and head tilts, while transient action poses render via `CustomPaint` `drawImageRect` using `(actionT * frames).floor().clamp(0, frames - 1)` frame indexing math with precached `ui.Image` handles and proper `.dispose()` teardown. Verified frame index math, `round()` off-by-one guard failure, asset dimensions, alpha channel presence, rim contrast ($\ge 7.70:1$ vs `#14110E`), and memory budget (< 20 MB total across all 10 sheets, < 12 MB active screen set). Total iOS app size measured at **46.0 MB**.

5. **Issue 51: Host Lobby Exit Room Closure (Resolved - August 9, 2026)**:
   - **Problem**: When a host left a lobby, `handleDisconnect` (`functions/src/index.ts`) checked `hasCard = room.cards.some(...)` and returned early before reaching host transfer, leaving player documents intact without a host. Furthermore, `GameService.dart` lacked an `else` branch in its room snapshot listener, stranding remaining clients in an unstartable, inescapable lobby without notice.
   - **Solution**: Implemented Option A phase-gating in `handleDisconnect`: if `disconnectedPlayer?.isHost === true` and `currentPhase === "lobby"`, all player documents and the room document are deleted in transaction, returning `{ success: true, roomClosed: true }`. In `GameService.dart`, extracted `_clearLocalRoomState()`, updated room listener to set `_roomClosed = true` on room deletion (`else if (_gameState != null)`), and added post-frame SnackBar eviction notice in `LobbyScreen` (`"The host has left. This room has closed."`).
   - **Observed Falsifying Output**:
     ```text
     1) closes the room when the host disconnects in the lobby:
        AssertionError: expected undefined to be true
        + expected - actual
        -undefined
        +true
     ```
   - **Over-reach Guard**: Verified in-game host transfer (`currentPhase !== "lobby"`) still transfers host to earliest-joined active player without closing room in both TS E2E and Dart unit suites (`test/room_closed_test.dart`).

## 2. Lessons that still bite

These are kept because each one describes a trap that is **still live in the codebase** — not because it is interesting history. Each points at the contract that now owns the detail.

### 2.1 `null` is not "absent" across the Dart ↔ TypeScript boundary
Dart sends an omitted optional as `null`; TypeScript's `!== undefined` guard treats that as a real value and writes it. This erased lobby settings and made the game unstartable (Issue 31). **Clients must omit keys rather than send null; callables must guard with loose `!= null`, never a falsy check** — `false` and `0` are legitimate values. Full contract: **`design_database_and_security.md` §7**.

### 2.2 The test harness has four structural blind spots
Each has hidden a real bug. None is a flaw to fix — they are limits to design around:
- **The emulator suite is written in TypeScript**, so an omitted key genuinely *is* `undefined` there. It cannot produce the payload the Dart client actually sends. Issue 31 lived behind this.
- **Client tests use a fake Firestore that does not enforce `firestore.rules`**, so non-host writes and `authUid` checks are never really exercised. Use real simulator clients for anything that must be correct — bots are server-seeded documents and do not exercise the client path at all.
- **`Image.asset` loads no bytes under `flutter test`.** `find.byType(Image)` counts widgets whether or not art exists, and a golden render of the mascot comes out blank. Verify art by decoding the PNG (`test/helpers/png_decoder.dart`) or on a simulator.
- **Bare `flutter analyze` reports ~678 errors** from vendored plugin source under gitignored `build/`. Always scope it: `flutter analyze lib test`.

### 2.3 Stream-rebuild guards are load-bearing
Firestore streams rebuild constantly. Every animation, sound and mascot pose is gated behind a **once-per-event key** (the `_advancedStateKeys` pattern; `_playedRevealForTargetId`; `_knownPlayerIds`). Remove one and the effect re-fires on every tick. A missing key is invisible in code review and only shows up on device — which is why Issue 34 makes the key a required argument.

### 2.4 Validate type and range before comparing
`3 <= null` is `false`, so a range check silently passes and the function returns an empty result far from the cause. Reject nonsense input outright and throw a readable `HttpsError`, not a raw `Error` — raw errors flatten to `INTERNAL` and tell the player nothing. Detail: **`design_rotation_engine.md` §5**.

### 2.5 Measure; do not estimate, and do not trust a test's name
- A layout overflow estimated at ~275 dp measured **593 dp**.
- A mascot shipped at **1.02:1** contrast — invisible — with a fully green suite.
- A test titled *"…rim contrast >= 4.5:1"* asserted only that a file was non-empty. **Read the assertion, not the title.**

### 2.6 `IconData` is a `final class`
`phosphor_flutter` extends it and therefore **cannot compile** on this SDK. Proven twice. The app vendors the Phosphor Light font directly instead. Detail: **`design_ui_direction.md` §7**.

### 2.7 Everything mutating goes through a Cloud Function
Clients read Firestore streams and write nothing to rooms; `firestore.rules` denies it. Transactions read before write. Detail: **`design_database_and_security.md`**.

## 3. Deliberately not built — do not re-propose

These were designed, costed and consciously **not** selected. Their absence is a decision, not an oversight:

- **P7 — Confidence Wager** ("seal it in blood"): stake points on your own forgery.
- **P9 — House Cards**: per-round modifiers.
- **P11 — The Final Gambit**: a comeback round for trailing players.
- **Issue 30 Option C**: making `_familyFriendlyOnly` a synced house rule. It stays client-local.
- **Issue 34 Option C**: priority arbitration between mascot poses. Available as an upgrade if reveal-screen collisions prove annoying in practice.

## 4. Resolved — index only

64 items resolved between May 24 and August 7, 2026. Full text is in `git log`; the durable consequences are in the design docs. Grouped by what they touched:

| Area | Items | Where the surviving contract lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Write architecture & multiplayer** — non-host writes blocked by rules, read-after-write transaction order, unhandled server errors, direct client writes in debug tools, full-object writes | Issues 1, 13, 14, 17, 18 + the May race/leak/transaction fixes | `design_database_and_security.md` |
| **Identity & reconnection** — device-stable `playerId`, seat re-binding, anonymous-auth loss, heartbeat volume, disconnect cleanup, host handoff | Issues 16, 36, 42, 15, 34, 35 | `design_database_and_security.md` §4–§5 |
| **Game-loop correctness** — score application on host override, timeout blank cards, inflated scores after disconnect, spectator miscounts, deterministic card resolution, reader re-indexing | Issues 26–35, 21 | `design_rotation_engine.md`, `design_scoring_and_ui.md` |
